Simple Flutter UI Application

This is a basic Flutter application that demonstrates the use of a few core widgets and concepts. The application includes a title bar, a centered column with a welcome message, a button that logs a message to the console when clicked, and an image fetched from the internet. The layout is clean and structured with proper alignment and spacing between widgets.
